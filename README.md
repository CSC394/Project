# Building 
To build the project, Spring Boot Utilizes Gradle Build tool.

There is nothing to download.

First clone the repository / branch.

Next run the command:

Unix/OSX: './gradlew build'

Windows: 'gradlew build'

You will see it download a bunch of dependencies.  This is normal.

Next, enter:

Unix/OSX: './gradlew bootRun'

Windows: 'gradlew bootRun'

Wait until you see a line that mentions Tomcat has started on port 8080.

From here, open your web browser, and you should see the Hello World.
